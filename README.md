# CDW Master Class - R Programming with Excel

## Description
**Bridging R Programming with Excel: The Future of Data Modeling** - This master class is designed to showcase the powerful combination of R programming with Excel for data analysis and modeling. Participants will learn how to leverage the statistical capabilities of R alongside the familiar interface of Excel, enabling them to create enhanced, dynamic, and robust data models.

## Structure
- **R Scripts Folder**: Contains all the R scripts that demonstrate various functionalities of R programming in conjunction with Excel.
- **Data Folder**: Includes CSV files used in the R scripts for practical demonstrations. These files represent typical datasets that one might encounter in a business environment.
- **Doc Folder**: Contains a PowerPoint presentation detailing the concepts covered in the master class, along with any additional documentation that supports the learning process.

## Working with R
For those new to R or seeking to enhance their skills, I recommend engaging with free online courses offered by platforms like [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) or [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). 

### Initial Setup
[Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/) - Precompiled binary distributions of the base system and contributed packages, Windows and Mac users most likely want one of these versions of R

Download and install [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads/) Desktop Open Source Edition.

Before diving into the scripts, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. Run the following commands in your R console:

```R
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("writexl")
```

These packages are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and interacting with Excel files.

## Conclusion
The CDW Master Class is a comprehensive introduction to integrating R programming with Excel. By the end of the session, participants will have a solid foundation in using these tools for advanced data analysis and modeling.
