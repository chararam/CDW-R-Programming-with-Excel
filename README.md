## Working with R
Great free online courses to gain familiarity with R.
[DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) or [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). The code below should be run in the console to install packages needed.

## Please install the following packages with this R code.
If you encounter any errors don't worry we will find time to work through them.  The `qdap` library is usually the trickiest because it requires Java and `rJava` and does not work on Mac.  So if you get any errors, try removing that from the code below and rerunning.  This will take **a long time** if you don't already have the packages, so please run prior to class, and at a time you don't need your computer ie *at night*.
